This is a fork of original nemomobile policy for putting the library to a given dir instead of a system one.
That is for satisfying Jolla Harbour rules.
For most of sane usage reasons you should be using the original library.

If you want to use the library in your project, check comments in src.pro

You'll need to define a PROJECT_SHORTNAME variable in your .yaml and still patch qmldir manually

Pull requests for automating qmldir change are very welcome.

original readme:

The org.nemomobile.policy QML plugin provides an API for communicating with the
libresource policy manager.

import QtQuick 1.1
import org.nemomobile.policy

Item {
    id: volumeHandler

    focus: true

    Keys.enabled: permissions.acquired
    Keys.onPressed: {
        if (event.key == Qt.Key_VolumeUp) {
            // increase volume
        } else if (event.key == Qt.Key_VolumeDown) {
            // decrease volume
        }
    }

    Permissions {
        enabled: volumeHandler.activeFocus
        autoRelease: true
        applicationClass: "player"

        Resource {
            type: Resource.ScaleButton
        }
    }
}
